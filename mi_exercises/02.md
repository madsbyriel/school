# Exercise 1:

![[01_01.png]]

 - Which arcs in the above constraint network are arc consistent?

The arc $\langle A, A < B \rangle$ is arc-consistent, since the condition holds for all values in A and all values in B.

 - How can the whole network be made arc consistent, i.e., which changes should be made to the domains of the variables making the network arc-consistent without eliminating potential solutions?

We should remove the $4$ from the domain of $B$ to make that arc to $C$ is consistent. Since we updated $B$ we need to make sure the arc to $A$ is still consistent, which is done by removing the $3$ from the domain of $A$. This results in:

$$
\begin{align*}
    & dom(A) &= \{1, 2\} \\
    & dom(B) &= \{2, 3\} \\
    & dom(C) &= \{3, 4\} \\
\end{align*}
$$

# Exercise 2:

Consider the following mini-Sudoku:

![[01_02.png]]

The empty fields have to be filled with numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4, such that each row, each column, and each of the 2 $\times$ 2 sub-squares contain each of these numbers exactly once.

1. Formalize this problem as a constraint satisfaction problem: define an appropriate set of variables, and a set of constraints that define the solutions of the sudoku (hint: instead of using constraints as on the lecture slide, define a smaller set of constraints, each constraint expressing the full condition for one row, one column, or one sub-square. We have not discussed off-the-shelf formal languages for expressing such constraints, so you should try to express them as formally as possible)

We have in total 4 rows, 4 columns and 4 blocks. In total we have 16 fields. Each of these fields can take on one of four values, constraints aside. We express each of the variable domains as $D_{ij}$ where $i$ is the row index, and $j$ is the column index:

$$
\{ \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \} \in D_{ij} | \forall i,j \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \}
$$

Next, we define each of the constraints. We label the constraints for rows and columns according the their index, the first row constraint would be $R_1$, likewise for the column $C_1$. We must not repeat numbers, and as such we express the column and row constraints as:

$$
\begin{align*}
    &C_j &= \{ V_{ij} \neq V_{i'j} | \forall i,i' \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \text{ where } i \neq i' \} \\
    &R_i &= \{ V_{ij} \neq V_{ij'} | \forall j,j' \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \text{ where } j \neq j' \} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Alternatively expressed, any value must not be repeated in a row, likewise for columns. We use a similar syntax for expressing each of the constraints for each of the blocks:

$$
\begin{align*}
    & B_1 &= \{ V_{ij} \neq V_{i'j'} | \forall i,i',j,j' \in \{1, 2\} \text{ where } i \neq i' \wedge j \neq j' \} \\
    & B_2 &= \{ V_{ij} \neq V_{i'j'} | \forall i,i' \in \{1, 2\} \forall j,j' \in \{3, 4\} \text{ where } i \neq i' \wedge j \neq j' \} \\
    & B_3 &= \{ V_{ij} \neq V_{i'j'} | \forall i,i' \in \{3, 4\} \forall j,j' \in \{1, 2\} \text{ where } i \neq i' \wedge j \neq j' \} \\
    & B_4 &= \{ V_{ij} \neq V_{i'j'} | \forall i,i',j,j' \in \{3, 4\} \text{ where } i \neq i' \wedge j \neq j' \} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Alternatively, any value within a block must not be repeated.

2. Draw the constraint network for this problem. If this gets too large, draw only the part of the network that is sufficient to answer the next question.

Nopedinope.

3. Apply the generalized arc consistency algorithm to show that the top left square must contain a 1. Does the operation of the algorithm resemble how you would come to that conclusion yourself?

We have several arcs constraining the top left value:

$$
\begin{align*}
    & \langle D_{11}, D_{11} \neq D_{21}\rangle & \text{effect: } D_{11}\backslash \{2\} \\
    & \langle D_{11}, D_{11} \neq D_{41}\rangle & \text{effect: } D_{11}\backslash \{3\} \\
    & \langle D_{11}, D_{11} \neq D_{13}\rangle & \text{effect: } D_{11}\backslash \{4\} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Each of these removes one possible value from the domain, $D_{11}$, leaving us with a single value left, $1$.

# Exercise 3:

Consider the following constraint network $\gamma = (V,D,C)$:

 - Variables: $V = \{a,b,c,d\}$
 - Domains: $\forall v \in V$: $D_v = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$
 - Constaints: $2|a-c| > 3$; $b^2-3d < 9$; $b + 3 < c$

Run the Generalized Arc Consistency(γ) algorithm, as specified in the lecture. Precisely, for each iteration of the while-loop, give the content of To-do-arcs at the start of the iteration, give the pair (x, c) removed from To-do-arcs, give the domain Dx of x after the call to Revise(γ, x, c), and give the pairs (y, c0) added into M

Todo: 
$$
\begin{align*}
    & \{ & \\
    & \langle D_a, & 2|a - c| > 3 \rangle, \\
    & \langle D_b, & b^2 - 3d < 9 \rangle, \\
    & \langle D_b, & b + 3 < c \rangle, \\
    & \langle D_c, & 2|a - c| > 3 \rangle, \\
    & \langle D_c, & b + 3 < c \rangle, \\
    & \langle D_d, & b^2 - 3d < 9 \rangle, \\
  \}& \\
\end{align*}
$$

Jesus, no more.

# Exercise 4

Consider the constraint graph of Figure 4.17 with named binary constraints. $r_1$ is a relation on $A$ and $B$, which we write as $r_1(A, B)$, and similarly for the other relations. Consider solving this network using variable elimination.

![[figure_02_04.png]]

- Suppose you were to eliminate variable $A$. Which constraints are removed? A constraint is created on which variables? (You can call this $r_{11}$.)

We eleminate the variable $A$ and now we have two 'dangling' relations, namely $r_2(A, C)$ and $r_1(A, B)$. We combine the two, and make a new relation $r_{11}(B, C)$.

- Suppose you were to subsequently eliminate $B$ (i.e., after eliminating $A$). Which relations are removed? A constraint is created on which variables?

When we eleminate $B$ we have three 'dangling' relations, namely $r_3(B, D)$, $r_4(B, E)$ and $r_{11}(B, C)$. We therefore combine these into a single new relation, $r_{12}(C, D, E)$.

# Exercise 5

Use Variable Elimination to solve the following CSP given by extensional constraints on Boolean variables A, B, C:

We first eliminate $A$. There's no special reason for this. First we write all the tables.

$r_1$
| $A$ | $B$ |
| - | - |
| t | f |
| t | t |
| f | t |

$r_2$
| $A$ | $C$ |
| - | - |
| t | f |
| f | t |

$r_3$
| $B$ | $C$ |
| - | - |
| t | f |
| f | t |

As stated we eliminate $A$ for no apparent reason, in SQL-like language we perform a join of A,B and A,C. In more programatic terms for each entry in A, B we append C from A, C as long as A = A from the different tables. We join A, B and A, C on A.

$r_4: r_1 \bowtie r_2$
| $A$ | $B$ | $C$ |
| - | - | - |
| t | f | f |
| t | t | f |
| f | t | t |

After eliminating duplicates after removing the column $A$ from $r_4$:

$r_5: \pi\{B, C\}r_4$
| $B$ | $C$ |
| - | - |
| f | f |
| t | f |
| t | t |

Now we join the relations $r_5$ and $r_3$ (graphically we converting two relations two and from the same domains to a single combined relation):

$r_6: r_3 \bowtie r_5$
| $B$ | $C$ |
| - | - |
| t | f |

The result of $r_6$ is single relation from $B$ to $C$, now we need to include possible values of $A$ and as such we join with table $r_4$:

$r_7: r_4 \bowtie r_6$
| $A$ | $B$ | $C$ |
| - | - | - |
| t | t | f |

and that is the conclusion. For this network, only a single solution exists.

# Exercise 6:

Consider the cryptarithmetic puzzle

![[puzzle_02_06.png]]

Each letter in a cryptarithmetic problem represents a different digit; note that F cannot be 0.

- Construct a constraint network representation for the puzzle. Hint: For each of the four columns in the table representation above we have a constraint. E.g. for the first column we have the constraint

$$
O + O = R + 10C_1
$$

where $C_1$ is an auxiliary variable representing what is carried over in the 10 column. Use similar auxiliary variables, say $C_2$ and $C_3$, for encoding what is carried over to the 100 and 1000 column, respectively.

To do this, we simply realize that the above constraint can be repeated for each of the variables, resulting in the following constraints

$$
\begin{align*}
    O + O &= R + 10C_1 \\
    W + W + C_1 &= U + 10C_2 \\
    T + T + C_ 2 &= O + 10C_3 \\
    C_3 &= F \\
\end{align*}
$$

As the variables $C_i$ represent the value which is carried over, we say that for example $W + W + C_1$ results in the digit $U$ and with any carry-over represented as $C_2$ which in turn used to calculate the digit for $O$. Finally, since $F$ isn't the result of any additions it essentially only the value which is carried over.

From these four constraints, and with the constraints mentioned in the task, we can construct the constraint network. However, first we shall define the domains of each variable:

$$
\begin{align*}
    domain(T) & \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \\
    domain(W) & \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \\
    domain(O) & \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \\
    domain(F) & \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \\
    domain(O) & \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \\
    domain(U) & \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \\
    domain(R) & \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Note that $F$ cannot be zero, and we do not represent this as a constraint but simply remove $0$ from the domain of $F$.

Finally, we have the constraint that all the variables must be different, with the exception of those we introduced ourselves ($C_i$). Instead of drawing the network, all the relations will be written out

$$
\begin{align*}
    O + O &= R + 10C_1 & r_1(O, R, C_1) \\
    W + W + C_1 &= U + 10C_2 & r_2(W, U, C_1, C_2) \\
    T + T + C_ 2 &= O + 10C_3 & r_3(T, O, C_2, C_3) \\
    C_3 &= F & r_4(F, C_3) \\
    \text{All different}& & r_5(F, O, U, R, T, W, O) \\
\end{align*}
$$

Based on these relations the network can easily be drawn.

- Perform a BacktrackingWithInference to find a solution to the puzzle. Hint: The ordering of the variables has a big impact on the solution size, so a good strategy would be to chose the variable with the smallest number of possible values. E.g. consider starting with $C_3 = 1$.

The algorithm goes something like this (put in words and simple terms):
Is the current solution inconsistent? I.e. there is no possible solution (refer to arc consistency). If yes, return inconsistent.
Is the current solution a total assignment (all values have been assigned)? If yes, return the solution (it is viable).

Perform arc consistency, and create a new network. This network will be used henceforth. The algorithm here is intended to be affected by the ongoing variable assignments that is performed in the last bit of the algorithm.

Select some random variable that has not yet been assigned.
For each random value in the domain of the variable, assign it and perform this algorithm on the new network and variable assignment. If it returns a solution, return that solution (propagate the solution downwards).

If you run out of values in the domain for this assignment, return inconsistent.

Ok, so we will try to follow this somewhat.

Depth 1:
$a = {C_3 = 1}$ we start with this from the given text.
We make an assignment (the only available), $F = 1$.

Depth 2:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1\}$
We make an assignment, $T = 5$ ($T$ needs to be at least $5$, otherwise $C_3 = 1$ can't be true).

Depth 3:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 5 \}$
We make an assignment, $C_2 = 0$

Depth 4:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 5, C_2 = 0 \}$
We make an assignment, $O = 0$ (only available value, since $T=5$ and $C_2 = 0$)

Depth 5:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 5, C_2 = 0, O = 0 \}$
We make an assignment, $W = 4$ (since $C_2 = 0$ we $W$ must be less than $5$)

Depth 6:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 5, C_2 = 0, O = 0, W = 4 \}$
We make an assignment, $C_1 = 1$.

Depth 7:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 5, C_2 = 0, O = 0, W = 4, C_1 = 1 \}$
We make an assignment, $U = 9$ since $W=4$ and $C_1=1$.

Depth 8:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 5, C_2 = 0, O = 0, W = 4, C_1 = 1, U = 9 \}$
Error!!! A previous assignment was impossible! Note that $O = 0$, which makes $C_1 = 1$ impossible! We go back and assign $C_1$ differently.

Depth 6:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 5, C_2 = 0, O = 0, W = 4 \}$
We make an assignment, $C_1 = 0$.

Depth 7:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 5, C_2 = 0, O = 0, W = 4, C_1 = 0 \}$
We make an assignment, $U = 8$, since $W=4$ and $C_1=0$.

Depth 8:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 5, C_2 = 0, O = 0, W = 4, C_1 = 0, U=8\}$
Error!!! We cannot say $O = 0$ because $O + O = R$ and that would force two variables to be equal, which is not allowed. We go back and change such that $O \neq 0$.

Depth 4:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 5, C_2 = 0 \}$
We make an assignment, $O = 0$ (only available value, since $T=5$ and $C_2 = 0$). Shiiit there are no other values to choose from! We go back further, to a new assignment of $T$ (keep in mind the values we have tried we may not try again)!

Depth 2:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1\}$
We make an assignment, $T = 9$.

Depth 3:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 9\}$
We make an assignment, $C_2 = 0$.

Depth 4:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 9, C_2 = 0\}$
We make an assignment, $O = 8$.

Depth 5:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 9, C_2 = 0, O = 8\}$
We make an assignment, $O = 8$.

Depth 6:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 9, C_2 = 0, O = 8\}$
We make an assignment, $W = 3$.

Depth 7:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 9, C_2 = 0, O = 8, W = 3\}$
We make an assignment, $C_1 = 1$.

Depth 8:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 9, C_2 = 0, O = 8, W = 3, C_1 = 1\}$
We make an assignment, $U = 7$.

Depth 9:
$a = \{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 9, C_2 = 0, O = 8, W = 3, C_1 = 1, U = 7\}$
We make an assignment, $R = 6$.

Finally we have a total assignment, $\{C_3 = 1, F = 1, T = 9, C_2 = 0, O = 8, W = 3, C_1 = 1, U = 7, R = 6\}$.

This followed the algorithm somewhat. Just remember to perform the Generalized Arc Consistency algorithm for each iteration with the given variable assignments. If the arc consistency results in any variable having an empty domain, then return inconsistent.
