# Exercise 1:

Consider that we have the following data-points, which we want to fit using linear regression:

| $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $y$ |
| ----- | ----- | --- |
| 1     | 1     | 2   |
| 0     | 0     | 0   |
| 1     | 0     | 3   |
| 2     | 1     | 2   |

What is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) error for the following sets of parameters:

 - $w0 = 0$, $w1 = 1$, $w2 = −1$
 - $w0 = 1$, $w1 = 1$, $w2 = 0$

 We follow the formula:

$$
w_0 + \Sigma_{i = 1}^n w_ix_i = \hat{y}
$$

Which for 3 weights is equivalent to

$$
w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 = \hat{y}
$$

For each of the four points data points, we denote $\hat{y}_i$ to specify the prediction for the datapoint $i$.

Now to calculate for $w0 = 0$, $w1 = 1$, $w2 = −1$ for each of the four data points:

$$
\begin{align*}
0 + 1 * 1 + -1 * 1 &= 0 \\
0 + 1 * 0 + -1 * 0 &= 0 \\
0 + 1 * 1 + -1 * 0 &= 1 \\
0 + 1 * 2 + -1 * 1 &= 1 \\
\end{align*}
$$

Now to calculate for the other set of weights ($w0 = 1$, $w1 = 1$, $w2 = 0$):

$$
\begin{align*}
1 + 1 * 1 + 0 * 1 &= 2 \\
1 + 1 * 0 + 0 * 0 &= 1 \\
1 + 1 * 1 + 0 * 0 &= 2 \\
1 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 1 &= 3 \\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we calculate the squared difference in $y$ and $\hat{y}$ for each of the two sets of weights:

$$
\begin{align*}
(2 - 0) * (2 - 0) &= 4 \\
(0 - 0) * (0 - 0) &= 0 \\
(3 - 1) * (3 - 1) &= 4 \\
(2 - 1) * (2 - 1) &= 1 \\
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
(2 - 2) * (2 - 2) &= 0 \\
(0 - 1) * (0 - 1) &= 1 \\
(3 - 2) * (3 - 2) &= 1 \\
(2 - 3) * (2 - 3) &= 1 \\
\end{align*}
$$

Finally we calculate the mean squared error for each of the the sets of weights (just a sum of the above diveded by 4):

$$
\begin{align*}
(4 + 0 + 4 + 1) / 4 &= 2.25 \\
(0 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 &= 0.75 \\
\end{align*}
$$

From this we can conclude that the second set of weights is the best since it minimizes the mean squared error, MSE.

# Exercise 2

Consider a database of cars represented by the five training examples below. The target attribute Acceptable, which can have values yes and no, is to be predicted based on the other attributes of the car in question. These attributes indicate 

- a) the age of the car (Age having values < 5 years and ≥ 5 years), 
- b) the make of the car (Make having states Toyota and Mazda), 
- c) the number of previous owners (#Owners having values 1, 2 and 3), 
- d) the number of kilometers (#Kilometers having values > 150k and ≤ 150k) and 
- e) the number of doors (#Doors having values 3 and 5).

- a) Calculate the entropy for the attribute no. Owners:

To do this, we will use the formula presented below (slide 34):

![[05_formula1.png]]

We define the values:

$$
p = (2/5, 1/5, 2/5)
$$

This is because we find that there are 3 elements in the domain of no. Owners, where

- in the case of no. Owners = 1 we have 2 cases.
- in the case of no. Ownsers = 2 we have 1 case.
- in the case of no. Ownsers = 3 we have 2 case.

Therefore a total of 5 cases, with a probability distribution represented by $p$. Therefore the entropy of no. Owners will be:

$$
\begin{align*}
Entropy([0.2, 0.4, 0.4]) &= -0.2 * log_2(0.2) - 0.4 * log_2(0.4) - 0.4 * log_2(0.4) \\
&= 1.5219280948873621 \\
\end{align*}
$$
